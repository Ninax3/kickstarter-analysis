# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends for the launch of a new play campaign for Louise in the US and maybe a musical in Great Britain (GB) with a goal of L4,000 
Based on the data alanysis Louise's US campaign trends show kickstarter theater productions are overall successful:
- For US play, the mean and 3rd quartile are equal for both the successful goals and successful pledged at about $5,000
- For US play the median are about equal for both successful goal and successful pledged at about $3,000
- For all kickstarters, the ideal month to start the campaign should be in May or June and last about 30 days or more
- For GB musical, Lousie should have a goal less than L4,000, specifically just under L2,000 was the upper quartile of pledges in the GB musical dataset 
- For GB musical, the goal should be budgeted closer to the mean to improve chances of success
- For GB musical, the ideal month to start the campaign should be in May or June and last about 30 days or more
